# DJsVisioShapes
Smart shapes and templates for Visio, for hardware diagrams, timing diagrams and other things.

This is my personal library that I've but together over 20 years of using Visio as a electronics hardware engineer.

Put them in your Visio shapes folder, usually "C:/Users/<username>/Documents/My Shapes".

1. DJs_Arrows.vss : Smart arrows that work on a 0.1" grid
Fat arrows for busses. Skinny arrows for wires. Clean abutment. Arrow heads maintain their shape when stretched.
2. DJs_TimingDiagram.vss : Shapes for making timing diagrams. Edges maintain their angle when stretched.
3. DJs_BasicShapes.vss : Squares and rectangles and stuff.
4. DJs_Odds_and_ends.vss : Shapes I've found useful over the years.
5. DJs_Logic_gates.vss : Some logic gates.
6. djs_word_pic.vstx : A stencil for an image in a Word document, with the grids set up nicely for
the above shape files.
7. djs_graphgrid.vst : A simple graph grid stencil.

Enjoy.
